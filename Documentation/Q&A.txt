1) Dicke regime is Doppler free effect due to buffer gas?
    The atoms collide with heavy particles (buffer gas) and thus their speed and momentum is decreased.

2) The magnetic field removes the Zeeman degeneracy or creates it?
    The magnetic field makes the Zeeman transitions to be further away to avoid those interaction with the electrons.

3) if the carrier frequency is at 4.59 GHz and the sidebands are at 4.596 GHz to the left and right, does that mean one of them is at 0 Hz?
    The Carries frequency is not at 4.59 GHz but in the optical domain at 894.6 nm

4) Objective of servo loops not clear 
    First servo loop: Lock optical domain carrier frequency
    Second servo loop: lock the sidebands in the desired coherent transition
